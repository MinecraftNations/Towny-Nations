	Log nation/town chat
	Log town/nation messages with timestamps. On login, see if there's been any events. Make command: /town log [page] to see messages.
	Update cache when adding/removing people
	Re-register a player after res delete
	Claim circle [radius] 
	Managed to claim 5 out of the 16 selected (x1,z1) .. (x2,z2).
	Ability to make NPC Residents profiles (not actual human entities). /townyadmin set mayor [town] npc
	Remember outposts coordinated. Charge extra tax on them. Allow for outpost teleporting.
	NewTown -> Min dist from claimed townblock.

Secondary:
	Commenting
	Replace getDataSource() with a manager class to allow multiple save formats at once.
	Make the formatting/wording for [nation] .. [nation] etc, better.
	Treat underscores as spaces during formatting.

Cool Concepts:
	In the wild, users who've registered less than X time are exempt to permissions.
